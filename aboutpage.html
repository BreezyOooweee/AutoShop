			<h2>Our Goal For The Community!</h2>
			<p>We are determined to help the people of our community by making cars more affordable. Car maintenance can be a headache and can put a dent in your wallet. Between being in a slump financially, not having a mode of transportation, now you have to find a rental, then finding quality and cheap parts, finding a good mechanic, looking around for the best quote, couldn't find a good quote so now you're on YouTube looking at do it yourself videos, and then finally just finding a payment plan with low interest to pay for the overpriced quote you were trying to avoid.
				<br>
				<br>
				 Maintenance, repairs, and modifications are important factors to keeping your car on the road. So important that most people even calculate or research the cost of these services before they even buy the car they want. This can deter people from buying a car and can be a setback in people's lives. My father was fed up with these maintenance costs and decided to undermine the system and show that these things were unnecessary and a product of greed. So, he built his business off selflessness, generosity, and the will to serve or help people. Ever since we have become the number one auto repair establishment in satisfaction and quality, dedicated to getting your car back on the road at a low cost.</p>

			</header>
			<p>We are a family-owned business that has been established for over 44 years. Passed down from my father we have treated our customers with family values. What started as a garage in the back of my home where I grew up as a child, my dad would help neighbors and friends out with car repairs.
				<br>
				<br>
